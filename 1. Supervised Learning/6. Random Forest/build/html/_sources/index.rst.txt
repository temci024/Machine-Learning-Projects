Project Overview
-------------------
The Digit Recognition with Random Forest project aims to accurately classify handwritten digits using the Random Forest algorithm.
It utilizes a dataset containing grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9), each represented as a 28x28 pixel grid.
The objective is to train a Random Forest classifier that can effectively recognize and classify digits based on their pixel values.
The project provides a user-friendly web interface powered by Streamlit, where users can explore the dataset, train the model, evaluate its accuracy, and visualize predictions on new images.
